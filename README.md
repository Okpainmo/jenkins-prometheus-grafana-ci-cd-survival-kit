# Jenkins-Prometheus-Grafana CI/CD Survival Kit For Python And NodeJs Projects.

This repository is a survival kit for implementing Ci/CD pipelines on Python and NodeJs project. It is **meticulously** packed with all the commands, and progressive steps required to fully implement robust CI/CD pipelines for the stated project stacks/types.

> P.S: I did this mainly for myself - to streamline and ease the repetitive task of creating multiple CI/CD pipelines on different project. **Feel free to bet your life on it.**

> Do well to drop a star, fork, and contribute, to make the sheet more robust for everyone who will find it helpful.

## How You Can Contribute.

Just below are some ways you can contribute.

1. Add relevant screenshot that describe each step that a command or process is implementing.
2. Update step explanations - to providing better comprehension for others.
3. Add new(**different**) Jenkins CI/CD workflows to make the sheet more robust and super-helpful.
4. ...

## CI/CD Workflows.

This project contains two different CI/CD workflow implementations.

1. A single virtual machine(VM) CI/CD workflow for small scale/startup projects.

2. A more robust CI/CD workflow with Docker as agent - which supports multiple VMs and/or deployments.

> 1. **The cloud service provider used, is Amazon Web Services(AWS) - with EC2 for Virtual Machines(VMs)**
>
> 2. **Each of the two(2) workflows will have two different implementations for:**
>
> - **A Jenkins freestyle job**
> - **A Jenkins Pipeline job - using a Jenkins file**

**IMPORTANT.**

This project assumes that you already know some solid amount of cloud and DevOps implementations.

It requires that you:

1. Have solid knowledge of some cloud and DevOps implementations.
2. Already know how to deploy a server(NodeJs or Python) on an AWS EC2 instance - using systemd for service management and persistence.

## Before You Contribute.

> This project will be a progressive one. I and any other contributors, will keep contributing relevant updates and information. This makes is very important for you to always share details about any contribution you wish to make before-hand, and avoid the needless stress of proceeding to make a contribution on a topic that is already on the way.

To contribute successfully, simply create a Github issues that mentions me, and I'll be right with you to discuss your
proposed/intended contribution.

Cheers!!!
